## Using

This extension provides a rich editing experience for Angular templates, both inline
and external templates including:

* Completions lists
* AOT Diagnostic messages
* Quick info
* Go to definition

### Commands

- `angular.restartNgServer` Restart Angular Language server
- `angular.openLogFile` Open Angular Server log
- `angular.getTemplateTcb` View Template Typecheck Block

### Configuration

- `angular.trace.server` enable angular language server trace log
- `angular.log` Enables logging of the Angular server to a file. This log can be used to diagnose Angular Server issues. The log may contain file paths, source code, and other potentially sensitive information from your project.
- `angular.view-engine` Use legacy View Engine language service.
- `angular.suggest.includeAutomaticOptionalChainCompletions` Enable/disable showing completions on potentially undefined values that insert an optional chain call. Requires TS 3.7+ and strict null checks to be enabled.

## Configuring compiler options for the Angular Language Service

The Angular Language Service uses the same set of options that are used to compile the application.
To get the most complete information in the editor, set the `strictTemplates` option in `tsconfig.json`,
as shown in the following example:

```
"angularCompilerOptions": {
  "strictTemplates": true
}
```

For more information, see the [Angular compiler options](https://angular.io/guide/angular-compiler-options) guide.

## Versioning

The language service extension relies on the `@angular/language-service` and `typescript` packages

for its backend. `@angular/language-service` is always bundled with the extension, and is always
the latest version at the time of the release.
`typescript` is loaded, in order of priority, from:

1. The path specified by `typescript.tsdk` in project or global settings.
2. _(Recommended)_ The version of `typescript` bundled with the Angular Language Service extension.
3. The version of `typescript` present in the current workspace's node_modules.

We suggest **not** specifying `typescript.tsdk` in your VSCode settings
per method (1) above. If the `typescript` package is loaded by methods (1) or (3), there is a potential
for a mismatch between the API expected by `@angular/language-service` and the API provided by `typescript`.
This could lead to a failure of the language service extension.
